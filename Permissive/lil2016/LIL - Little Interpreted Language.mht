<h1>LIL</h1>
<hr>
<b>LIL</b> (<b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage) is a small hi=
ghly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and unix shells. The langua=
ge has two implementations: one in C which consists of a pair of <tt>c</tt>=
 and <tt>h</tt> files and one in Free Pascal which consists of a single <tt=
>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a Lazarus package for the latter is provided.=
 The library is written by Kostas "Bad Sector" Michalopoulos and licensed=
 under the <a href=3D"https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib">zlib license</a=
>. From this site you can download an archive containing the latest version=
 of both the C and Free Pascal implementations, some examples and documenta=
tion.
